A user can log into this website and create a new account.
With this account, they can publish a new article that they write under a "Skin"
A skin is a poor representation/knockoff of a news outlets website.
This is satire.

They can also revisit, share, and edit their articles.
There should be an admin page where admins can manage users and articles.
